					<h1>Composer</h1>

			<div class="row">

				<div class="col-12 col-lg-7">

					<p>Nate’s music varies from the slow and somber to the spirited and visceral. While it’s true for each composer that their musical language evolves over time, Nate approaches each and every piece with a unique goal and mindset. It can be said, however, that he is particularly interested in developing systems and patterns that work in concordance with his natural musical inclinations. Nate is well-acquainted with acoustic composition/orchestration for a variety of instruments and ensembles and is experienced in electronic synthesis, recording, and audio production.</p>

					<p>Notable works include “Compré Pocas Copas” which received the first place prize for the 2023 Ithaca College Choral Composition Contest, and <i>S.O.S.</i> a piece recently premiered by the Mohonasen High School concert band. Nate is always looking to write or arrange for musicians/ensembles local and remote.</p>

					<p>Drawing experience from classical, jazz, musical theater, and barbershop quartet traditions, Nate is a versatile tenor singer. For four years he sang with the Ithaca College Jazz Vocal Ensemble, from which the famous New York Voices began their career as a group. Currently, Nate sings with the choir and chamber ensembles at First Presbyterian Church of Albany.</p>

					<p>Nate has been singing barbershop for over ten years, including with Schenectady's Electric City Chorus, and the Upstate Harmonizers. His quartet, Catalyst, have competed multiple times internationally and are the 2024 Northeastern District champions. In addition to competing, the quartet is always looking to give back to their communities and encourage others to enjoy and participate in barbershop singing. In January of 2025, Catalyst was the teaching staff quartet for the first Harmony X-plosion camp to be hosted in Schenectady, NY -- this event brought together high school-age singers from throughout the capital region to have them learn and perform barbershop-style music and participate in an evening concert featuring other local quartets and choruses. Eager to perform and teach locally in the public and at school events, Catalyst continues to hone their craft and be an encouraging force in the barbershop singing world. Visit Catalyst’s Facebook page for upcoming events and updates.</p>
