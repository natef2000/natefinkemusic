					<p>The son of a musician and equipped from a young age with a fascination for understanding music, Nate took great interest in music theory and arranging early on. In school, he engaged in musical extracurriculars and decided to study composition more seriously in college. Nate thrived at Ithaca, expanding his compositional technique and voice while connecting with countless talented professors and peers. Nate is well-acquainted with acoustic composition and orchestration, having written for a myriad of chamber and large ensembles. Electronic composition, synthesis, and audio recording and production are equally enthralling approaches Nate has utilized in creating music. Nate takes particular interest in the combination or juxtaposition of elements from varying styles of music in new settings.</p>

					<p>Notable works and projects include a short piece titled "Breeze" (2022) for Arcomusical – a unique and relatively new ensemble of instruments inspired by the Brazilian berimbau – and over 10 minutes of original music written for a production of <i>House of Desires</i> at Ithaca College’s Dillingham Center. The music from this production will be performed at IC’s inaugural celebration of the newly-combined School of Music, Theatre, and Dance in October of 2022. Nate received the Louis Smadbeck Prize in 2022 for his song cycle, <i>The Bells</i> with text by Edgar Allan Poe. The full piece was performed at his senior recital in March of the same year.</p>
